# Overview

GSim is a Monte Carlo simulation tool used to model team dps. It allows for the formation of arbitrary combination of any characters.

# Getting started

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to changing the repo name, auto update function unfortunately broke. If you have a version prior to v0.2.14 (last updated any time before Nov 8, 2021), please uninstall the app and redownload it again. Sorry for the inconvenience**

GSim now has a graphical desktop application available (previous web version discontinued due to performance issues). You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/genshinsim/gcsimui) or download the latest [release](https://github.com/genshinsim/gcsimui/releases).

In addition, you can visit the gsim's website at [https://www.gcsim.app/](https://www.gcsim.app/). On there you will find pre-written action list to use with your teams (so you do not have to build your own if you do not wish to). This is still a work in progress and will grow over time.

## Project status

The project is still currently under heavy development. Not every character/weapon/artifacts have been implemented. There are also many quality of life improvements that can be made. Currently this project is developed by one person (me) and as such development speed is not as fast as it can be. If you wish to contribute, please see below for ways you can help out.

## Contributing

If you are looking to contribute, the following are some key areas that you can help out with. If you're interested, please don't hesistate to reach out on the sim's [discord](https://discord.gg/m7jvjdxx7q)

- Comprehensive frame counts of every character's abilities, including but not limited to:
  - Hit mark frame (not just animation frame, which is currently in the KQM library)
  - Cooldown start frame
  - Energy drain frame
  - Particle proc frame (relative to hit mark)
- Team comp damage validation between actual game play and sim. This is done by recording videos of actual gameplay footage, and then reproducing the same team/artifact/items/targets in the simulator and comparing results frame by frame. This means both comparing the damage output as well as the reactions. The simulator should be able to reproduce actual gameplay faithfully.
- Building action list for various common team comps and comparing/validating the result vs actual in game gameplay
- Helping with documenting the sim in the wiki
- Further testing of in game reactions, primarily EC and chain freeze duration.
- Just in general using the sim for calculations/weapon comparisons/day 1 testing etc...
- If you would like to contribute code please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
