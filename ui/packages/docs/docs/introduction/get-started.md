# Getting Started

To get started, simply head over to our [website](https://gcsim.app).

Either check out our [tutorial](/guides/building_a_simulation_basic_tutorial) on how to write your own sim or start by [importing](/guides/importing_from_sim) from another shared sim by someone else.


For more detailed usage, check out our other guides [here](/guides), the [reference section](/reference) or [game mechanics section](/mechanics).
